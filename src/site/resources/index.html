    <h2><a name="intro">1. What is Proai?</a></h2>

    <p>
        Proai is a repository-neutral, Java web application supporting the
        <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">Open
            Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting</a> (OAI-PMH) version
        2.0. By implementing a repository-specific driver, developers can provide
        a full-featured OAI-PMH access point to their existing software.
    </p>

    <p>
        Proai offers the following features:
    <ul>
        <li> Record caching. Proai maintains it's own up-to-date copy of all
            records from the source repository.
            This design has the following benefits:
            <ul>
                <li> Performance. Delivery to harvesters is very fast and does not
                    put a load on the source repository.
                </li>
                <li> Reliability. Temporary unavailability of the source repository
                    does not disrupt the OAI-PMH interface or put it out-of-synch.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Automatic record validation with schema caching.</li>
        <li> Configurable OAI response sizes.</li>
        <li> Support for date-selective harvesting with seconds granularity.</li>
        <li> Support for flat or hierarchical sets.</li>
        <li> Support for persistent deleted records.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="sec2">
    <h2><a name="diff">2. How does it work?</a></h2>

    <p>
        Before attempting to use Proai for your own OAI-PMH needs, you
        should have a basic understanding of how it works.
    </p>

    <div class="subsect">
        <h4>Overview</h4>

        <p>
            Proai is installed as a service that sits between a source
            repository and OAI harvesters. On the front end, it responds
            to OAI requests by consulting its local XML Record Cache.
            On the back end, it keeps this cache up-to-date by periodically
            communicating with the source repository through a repository-specific
            interface.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="images/overview.png"/>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsect">
        <h4>Front End</h4>

        <p>
            When a harvester sends an OAI request, Proai interprets the
            request and consults the <i>record cache</i>, which consists
            of database tables and XML record files on disk.
        </p>

        <p>
            If a response exceeds a configured number of records, Proai
            takes care of splitting it into multiple parts and generating a
            <code>resumptionToken</code> for each part. In OAI-PMH,
            this is known as
            <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#FlowControl">Flow Control</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The front end depends solely on the record cache. It does not
            directly access the source repository and therefore can do its job
            even when the source repository is unavailable.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsect">
        <h4>Back End</h4>

        <p>
            The job of Proai's back-end is to keep the record cache up to date.
            This is done through a process known as the <i>update cycle</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            During an update cycle, the <i>cache updater</i> communicates
            with the source repository via the <a href="api/proai/driver/OAIDriver.html">OAIDriver interface</a>.
            An update cycle progresses as follows:
        <ol>
            <li> First, the updater queries for the current list of all sets to
                see if any have changed since the previous cycle. If so, the database
                is updated accordingly.
            </li>
            <li> Next, it queries for the list of new/modified records and enqueues
                them for processing.
            <li> Finally, the updater processes the queue,
                committing each change to the record cache. For each record, this
                involves getting the XML from the remote location, validating it,
                and removing it from the queue.
            </li>
        </ol>

        Using Proai for your own repository software is a matter of creating
        an
        <code>OAIDriver</code>
        implementation. See the included source code of <code>
        <a href="api/proai/driver/impl/OAIDriverImpl.html">OAIDriverImpl</a>
